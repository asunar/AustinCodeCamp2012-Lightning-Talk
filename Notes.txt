Hello everyone. Thanks for attending the Cross Platform Mobile app session

Who?
My name is Alper - .NET Developer by day, Ruby/Rails/JS/NodeJS newbie at night

What?
In this session I will go over the process I followed to publish a cross platform (iPhone - Android) in the respective app stores.

Why?
To inspire you to create your own mobile apps 

Don't know Objective-C, Java? No problem
Don't have a Mac? No worries
